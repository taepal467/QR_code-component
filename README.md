## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I am stil learning how to use 
*  <div> tags in HTML 
* margin and padding in CSS.

From my understanding, margins is the space between elements and padding is the space between elements and border? Still confused as to when to use either margin or padding.


### Continued development

I am comfortable using HTML. CSS is what I need to focus and practice more. Positioning elements on a page is where I struggle. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Great resource for web development. I use it for reference when using CSS properties.
- [Developer tools](GoogleChrome)- I used this to alternate any changes, so that way I won't have to keep entering/deleting any code in the text editor. The box model is also useful to calculate margins and paddings.
